# Terminal Chatbot
- This project is a terminal-based chatbot agent built with TypeScript and Node.
- The libraries used in this project are `Langchain` and `Groq`.

---
## Installation and Setup
- First, make sure you have [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download) and [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) installed on your machine;
- Once that’s done, clone the repository using `git clone`:
  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Andr3Dav1d/terminal-chatbot.git && cd terminal-chatbot
```

* After that, install the required packages by running:
```bash
npm install
```

* Then start the code using `node .` or `node index.ts`. The setup is done directly in the terminal.

## Getting the Groq API Key

* The API key is required for the chatbot to work.
* To get one, create it [here](https://console.groq.com/keys), copy it, and paste it in the initial setup prompt when asked for the key.
